													<h3>My life and philosophy</h3>
													<p>I was fortunate enough to have been born in an awesome family, living a comfortable life on the Montreal South Shore.
														With all the opportunities I was given, I decided to do the only thing I felt was appropriate: becoming somewhat of a modern-day "scholar",
														spending my days constantly improving, well, everything that I choose to take on. Throughout my whole existence, I've practiced countless things,
														some that I dropped due to lack of interest (and limited time!) and some that have stuck with me for years. For example, playing the drums is something that is literally in my blood:
														I've performed many times for school events and in a jazz big band. The Japanese language is another one; for years, I have been practicing, without formal classes, how to read and write upwards of 1000 japanese characters.
														I do those things not because I am forced to or because they're "useful", but simply because they're fun.<br>
														Over time, this strategy for learning shaped my mentality; I now honestly believe that I can do anything given enough time and resources.
														The beginner's journey from know-nothing to master is one that I always seek to re-embark on, time and time again, precisely because I know that I always reach the end when I put my mind to it.
														Because of this, it's hard for me to append a professional label to myself and proudly say: "I'm a programmer!", because I'm not a programmer: I just decided to invest lots of points on climbing this branch of my skill tree.
														I'm not quite a physicist, or a mathematician, a computer scientist, a programmer, a musician, a linguist, and I'm not a pro indie dev either (or a writer, hopefully that doesn't show hehe). It's the combination of all these things that shape me. <br>
														And here's the thing: I see other people the same way! This is why I always like helping others: the teacher/student relationship is a favorite of mine, and I enjoy being on both sides, knowing that whoever I help out can share with me their own expertise.

												
													</p>
													<p>Change of topic: I'm trying to look all pro here, I almost forgot to mention that I like playing games too!
														I tend to be sort of a Nintendo fanboy, since I happened to play Nintendo games as a child and like their philosophy
														for game design and the timeless style of their creations. Zelda, Pokemon, Metroid, Xenoblade Chronicles, Smash (competitively!), and of course Mario (Odyssey is coming out tomorrow at the time of writing this!!!).
														I'm always on the lookout to make and play good games, so if you are a developer reading this, do get in touch!
